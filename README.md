🚀 Mistral FAISS-based Retrieval QA Application
This repository contains a 🧩 Streamlit application that leverages FAISS for efficient similarity search and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using Hugging Face models. The app allows users to upload a FAISS index, metadata, and CSV data to perform retrieval-augmented question answering with source documents.

✨ Features
⚡ FAISS Integration: Efficient similarity search using FAISS.
🌐 Streamlit Interface: User-friendly web interface for uploading files and interacting with the model.
🤖 Hugging Face Models: Utilizes Hugging Face's language models for generating responses.
📝 Retrieval-Augmented Generation: Combines retrieval with generation to provide contextually accurate answers with source references.
